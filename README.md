# 📰 Fake News Detector

This project is a web-based Fake News Detection system built using **Python**, **Django**, and **Machine Learning** algorithms. It analyzes news content and predicts whether it is **REAL** or **FAKE** using models like SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and RNN.

## 🚀 Features
- User & Admin login system
- Upload and view news datasets
- Preprocessing and text cleaning
- ML model training and evaluation
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score display
- Real-time news prediction from input

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python, Django
- **ML Models:** Scikit-learn (SVM, NB, LR), RNN
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database:** SQLite

## 📊 Algorithms Used
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

## 🧪 How It Works
1. User enters or uploads news content
2. The system cleans and vectorizes the input
3. ML models classify the text
4. Output: “REAL” or “FAKE”
